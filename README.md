# Credleaf üåø

**Credleaf** is a B2B SaaS concept that turns everyday business spending into verified climate action. Designed for mid-sized companies in emerging ESG markets like the UAE, Credleaf automates carbon offsetting by linking corporate expenses to certified green vendors. Verified micro carbon credits are transparently recorded on blockchain, enabling real-time ESG reporting and giving companies a competitive edge without manual overhead.


## Problem

Mid-sized companies face increasing pressure to demonstrate environmental responsibility, but navigating carbon credits is complex, costly, and inaccessible without **dedicated ESG teams**. Existing systems suffer from trust issues like greenwashing and lack of auditability.


## Solution

Credleaf makes climate action effortless. Companies connect their expense data or corporate cards to the platform. Whenever they spend at a pre-vetted eco-friendly vendor (like EV leasing, green logistics, or renewable energy providers), they automatically earn verified carbon credits.

These credits are:
- Fractionalized and tied to spend
- Recorded on-chain for full transparency
- Displayed on a live ESG dashboard
- Instantly retirable with one click
- Packaged into ESG reports and certification for PR or compliance

This turns business operations into measurable, trusted environmental impact without adding operational burden.


## Why Credleaf Stands Out

Credleaf is built for a fast-growing, regulation-driven market. With governments across the UAE and MENA pushing for ESG compliance and the global voluntary carbon market projected to exceed $50B by 2030, there's growing demand for simple, credible tools.

What makes Credleaf different:
- **Zero admin burden** ‚Äì no legal or compliance teams needed
- **Verified on-chain credits** ‚Äì real, tamper-proof ESG claims
- **Built-in loyalty logic** ‚Äì encourages spend at sustainable vendors
- **Modular design** ‚Äì ready to integrate with banks, fintechs, and procurement systems
